Here i have used Java 17 as my language and used gradle repository and IntelliJ tool to build it.

First i have created file name Demo Controller, which has api calls to all /add, /balance, /spend methods. It is main controller class which redirects to particular class.
I have created 3 model objects called
1. add request( which has variables as payer, timestamp, points)
2. spend request(which has variable of points)
3. spend response(has variables as payer, points)

Then i have stored the values using Arraylists and added for each new entry.

in the java class named DemoService their are 3 methods
1. add mehod which will add the payer, timestamp, points details
2. spend method which will spend the points based on timestamp
3. balance method which will show the remaining balance. 

In order to run this code one need to have java 17, intellij, gradle.
